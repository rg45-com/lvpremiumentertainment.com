			            		<p>You can definitely try, but we don't recommend it.  Unfortunately, there are a lot of independent operators out there that put their information online to try and attract these kinds of jobs.  There's no guarantee of quality, or that the person/group that you pick will even show up.  We are always sad to hear this, but it does happen sometimes with the random internet groups.</p>

								<p class="no-margin">With our contracting process, we protect your interests and ours from these potential pitfalls.  We have the experience to weed out the charlatans from the true professionals and tolerate nothing less than the best from the people that we hire.</p>
