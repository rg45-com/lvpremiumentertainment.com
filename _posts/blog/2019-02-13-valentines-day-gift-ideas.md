Valentine’s day is upon us again, and I can bet there are more than a few people out there that are stumped as to what to get their significant other during the 2019 season of love.  There are, of course, the old standbys such as flowers and chocolates.  A piece of meaningful jewelry could also be a great option.  In the midst of the hustle and bustle it’s easy to fall back on these gifting ideas.  Why not?  They provide you with a convenient way to say something to your partner that is meaningful, and from the heart.  This year, though, I would encourage you to think outside the box.  So often it is not so much the item that makes the impact you want, but rather the thought that goes in to your selection.  Of course, you must take you and your significant other’s personal tastes when selecting your gift, but don’t discount the effect that a live musician might be able to have as part of your 2019 Valentine’s gift.  



I know what you’re thinking, “that’s so cheesy,” “my partner would never be in to that,” “that sounds expensive.” Well, you’re not wrong necessarily.  There definitely is a cheese factor to having some come play a love song for the two of you while you drink wine and eat dinner.  The right song and place with meaning for both of you could be just you’re looking for.  You never know if someone would appreciate it unless you give it a shot.  I will say that if the song is meaningful for both, you definitely have a shot.  Let’s be honest, if you’re already thinking about buying jewelry, then the cost isn’t really something that you’re super concerned with.  That being said, most musicians would consider the time they are actually being required to show up and play in the amount that they charge.  What’s the harm?  Get a few quotes and go from there.  Hey, if you end up deciding that it’s not for you, then there is still the option of flowers and chocolates isn’t there?



Happy Season of love to all the couples out there!  Be different, be meaningful, your partner will definitely appreciate the gesture!
