Congratulations, you’re getting married!  Now the hard part begins.  All the planning that goes into your special day can seem overwhelming.  There are endless details and questions to attend to.  Flowers, cake, meal, how many guests, gift registry, honeymoon.  It’s enough to make anyone go nuts!  We here at LV Premium Entertainment want to be of help.  In an effort to help you make some of your entertainment related choices, we’ve compiled a list of traditional wedding ceremony music.  We’ve also included some suggestions on types of groups/musicians to make your ceremony extra special.

The music- Of course everyone has heard of the Wedding March and the Bridal Chorus.  There are quite a few traditional songs that are a fit for most ceremonies.  The choice of music, for the most part, is up to you.  You may run into some restrictions depending on your venue though.  If you are renting out a private hall for your ceremony and reception, you’ll likely have your pick of anything you want for music.  If you are looking at a church wedding, however, you may want to check with them to see if there are any restrictions on the songs they allow for a religious service.  This would only be an issue if you were looking to have songs from more popular music sources.

Here is a list of more traditional song choices and their role in the ceremony:

1. Canon in D by Pachelbel- Entrance music for the Mother’s and Bridesmaids. (Instrumental)
2. Jesu, Joy of Man’s Desiring by J.S. Bach- Alternative choice for Bridesmaids entrance or Mother’s entrance. (Instrumental)
3. Bridal Chorus “Here Comes the Bride” by Wagner- The Most popular choice for the entrance of the Bride. (Instrumental)
4. Arrival of the Queen of Sheba by Handel- A wonderful secondary choice for the entrance of the bride. (Instrumental)
5. Trumpet Voluntary “Prince of Denmark’s March” by Clarke- Typically can be used during the preparation of the gifts during a ceremony that includes communion. (Instrumental)
6. Ave Maria by Schubert- A typical choice of song during the serving of communion. (Either instrumental or vocal)
7. Wedding March by Mendelssohn- The most well-known song for the recessional/exit of the Wedding party. (Instrumental)

Who should play these songs?

There are several great options for you to choose from.  A lot of people like to go very traditional here and have a string group play for their ceremony.  String groups are great for this setting.  They provide an air of elegance and tradition.  If, however, you are looking for something a little less traditional you might consider these great options as well.

1. A woodwind quartet- These groups provide the same traditional type of sound that a string group does, but with a different airier feeling to the music.  The instruments that typically are in these groups include different combinations, but can include flutes, clarinets, oboes, bassoons, and more than likely will be a mix of all of these.
2. A brass quartet- Not a typical wedding sound, but still a great option. These groups tend to provide more of a regal sound to your ceremony, which can be a great combination for certain pieces of music.
3. Some combination of all three of these- Feel free to mix and match!  There are no rules that say you can only have one type of group.  If you want different sounds for different parts of the ceremony, this is a perfect option.

No matter what music or group you decide for your ceremony, make sure that it fits what you want for your day.  Discuss your requests with your venue to make sure that the group and musical choices can be accommodated. Get an experienced music professional to help coordinate your wishes with the performers.  Here’s wishing you a fantastic wedding, and wonderful journey with your partner!
